 A revolutionary decentralized protocol redefining privacy and security within DeFi. Trade directly from your wallet with enhanced privacy features. Trade like a ghost with GhostMark! 

With the use of the newly proposed ERC-5564  standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that aims to enhance privacy and confidentiality in token transfers. We aim to build upon the concepts of stealth addresses and confidential transactions to provide improved privacy features compared to traditional ERC-20 tokens.

ERC-5564 introduces the use of stealth addresses, which are cryptographic addresses associated with token holders. These addresses do not reveal the token holder's identity or transaction history, providing a higher level of privacy.

Similar to confidential transactions in other privacy-focused blockchains (Zcash, XMR), ERC-5564 transactions hide the transaction amount from on-chain observers. This ensures that the token transfer amount remains confidential.

This is accomplished through the highly favourable Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKs) instead of ZK-SNARKS or ZK-STARKS. We chose NIZK because it requires no trusted-setups like the latter.
